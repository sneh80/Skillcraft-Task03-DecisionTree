# SkillCraft Internship ‚Äì Task 03  
### Decision Tree Classifier (Bank Marketing Dataset)

## üìå Project Overview
This project is part of my **SkillCraft Internship (Data Science)**.  
In this task, I implemented a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the **Bank Marketing Dataset**.  

The project includes:
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
- **Model Training using Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Evaluation with Accuracy & Classification Report**  
- **Visualizations (Feature Importance, Confusion Matrix, and Decision Tree Plot)**
